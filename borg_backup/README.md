# Home Assistant Add-on BorgBackup

## Summary

This Add-on uploads the contents of `/backup` to a remote [Borg Backup](https://www.borgbackup.org/) server.

## Installation

Add this repository's URL as an Add-on repo to your Hassio via Supervisor → Add-on store → Repositories.

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available:

```yaml
user: u123456
host: u123456.your-storagebox.de
port: 23
path: ./borg/my-hassio-server
archive: hassio
passphrase: a secret passphrase
borg_remote_path: borg12  # use PATH as borg executable on the remote (default: “borg”)
prune_options: '--keep-daily=8 --keep-weekly=5 --keep-monthly=13'
```

## First run

When the Add-On runs for the first time, it will display an SSH public key like this:

```
[15:15:00] INFO: A public/private key pair was generated for you.
[15:15:00] NOTICE: Please use this public key on the backup server:
[15:15:00] NOTICE: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHRHnaf0uiRPxVYKJ8PcfK5GJLz/omuZYS5627v1+U0i hassio
[15:15:00] INFO: Trying to initialize the Borg repository.
```

You will have to **copy this key** to the server's `./ssh/authorized_keys` file.


## Usage

Run this Add-on whenever you would like to upload your backups to the Borg server. Here's an automation that achieves this:

```yaml
- alias: Upload snapshots to Borg
  id: upload_snapshots_to_borg
  trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: '5'
    minutes: '0'
    seconds: '0'
  action:
  - service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      # your add-on identifier will differ from this one
      # find it as part of the add-on URL in
      # Supervisor -> Add-ons
      addon: abcdef01_borg_backup
```

Please note that this Add-on does not trigger Hassio snapshots. You will have to do this manually or create an automation for it like so:

```yaml
- alias: Create Snapshot
  id: create_snapshot
  trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: '3'
    minutes: '0'
    seconds: '0'
  action:
  - service: hassio.snapshot_full
```
